# FdF - Fils de Fer (wireframe) - MacOS
 This project is about creating a simplified **3D graphic** representation of a relief landscape. The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping.
 This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter.

##### Using MiniLibX
MiniLibX  is  an  easy  way  to  create graphical software, without any X-Win- dow/Cocoa programming knowledge. It provides simple window creation, a drawing tool, image and basic events management.

```
./fdf map_file
